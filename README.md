## 👨‍💻 About Me

With over **14 years of experience** in enterprise application development, I've worked extensively with **Java**, **Spring Boot**, and **Apache Kafka** to architect and deliver scalable solutions, especially in the **BFSI domain**. My career spans both **monolithic and microservices architectures**, and I’ve successfully led efforts in **monolith-to-microservices migration**.

🔁 On the flip side, I’m passionate about learning and evolving — currently diving deep into **AI/ML/GenAI** while pursuing an **MBA in FinTech** at **BITS Pilani** to bridge the gap between tech and business in the future of financial services.
